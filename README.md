# My SQL Playground Repository

Welcome to my SQL Playground repository. I've created a comprehensive database to manage coffee shop employee information, coffee shop details, store locations, and supplier data. 

## Highlights

- SQL scripts that showcase various database management tasks and query examples.
- Sample databases for real-world data scenarios and SQL manipulations.
- A personal collection of SQL resources and techniques.
